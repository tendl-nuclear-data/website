A minimal repository to demo the use of [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) and GitHub pages to host the TENDL website.

For this proof of concept I have just uploaded the TENDL 2025 Application Library for Neutrons.

You can naviage to the webpage from the homepage or go directly to that application library page

- [https://tendl-nuclear-data.github.io/website/application-libraries/](https://tendl-nuclear-data.github.io/website/application-libraries/)

I should also mention GitHub pages accepts custom domains (e.g https://openmc.org/ is done with GitHub pages)
Zendo scales to store all the TENDL data and much more
